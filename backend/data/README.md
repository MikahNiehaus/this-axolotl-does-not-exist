## Axolotl Dataset Preparation

To train the model for generating axolotl images, you will need to download a dataset of axolotl images. Follow the steps below to obtain and prepare the dataset:

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   You can find a suitable dataset of axolotl images from various online sources. One recommended source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), where you can search for "axolotl" datasets. Alternatively, you can use the following link to download a dataset directly:
   - [Axolotl Dataset](https://example.com/axolotl-dataset.zip) (replace with actual dataset link)

2. **Extract the Dataset**:
   After downloading the dataset, extract the contents of the zip file. You should have a folder containing multiple axolotl images.

3. **Organize the Data**:
   Place the extracted images into the `backend/data/axolotl_images` directory. If the directory does not exist, create it:
   ```
   mkdir -p backend/data/axolotl_images
   ```

4. **Update the Model Configuration**:
   Ensure that the model in `backend/models/generator.py` is configured to read images from the `backend/data/axolotl_images` directory. You may need to adjust file paths in the code accordingly.

5. **Data Augmentation (Optional)**:
   To improve the model's performance, consider applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, or color adjustments. This can be done using libraries like TensorFlow or Keras.

6. **Training the Model**:
   Once the dataset is prepared, you can proceed to train the model using the training scripts provided in the backend. Refer to the documentation in `backend/app.py` for instructions on how to start the training process.

By following these steps, you will have a properly prepared dataset for training your axolotl image generation model.
